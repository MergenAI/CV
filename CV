I'm Berke Katrancı. I'm a second semester Computer Sciences student at TU Braunschweig. Here you can read my detailed CV

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When I was in high school, I became interested in one area: physics. Physics, especially electricity, fascinated me. I became interested in philosophy when I was in 10th grade at high school. I learned Photoshop for fun when I was 16 years old. class attended. I became interested in software in the summer of 10th grade and learned HTML and CSS myself. At the end of high school, I became interested in mathematics and chemistry. Math, especially calculus, was fun.

In my third year of high school, I got the idea to fly in the sky with a friend and we joined our school's rocket team and I was elected to the team as head of the Electronics department. I helped design the starting and ignition systems. During that time, we achieved the achievement of finishing runners-up as a team in the school basketball competition. At the same time, I started reading "Feynman Lectures". While reading this book I was interested in quantum physics. After being interested in physics for a long time, I became interested in engineering. I became interested in many areas of engineering. We could not participate in the rocket competition due to the 2020 pandemic; I would have been the deputy leader if we had participated.

In my 3rd year of high school, I learned 3D modeling with the Blender app in my free time. In my senior year, I was elected Class President of the Honor Board. I lost the honors committee presidency by 3 votes. I concentrated on my classes in the third and fourth grades of high school. I graduated high school with honors. During my high school life, I received 8 certificates of recognition, 2 certificates of honor and 2 certificates for high achievements in 8 semesters. My year-end GPAs in high school are 90.68, 95.17, 95.33, 96.95 out of 100. My final grade on the German system is 1.27

I got less than 1% success in university entrance exam and joined Izmir University of Economics, Department of Computer Science. Working independently, I learned more software skills than university could give in one year. I learned the entire syllabus in a month. My grade point average in the first semester was 3.58/4 (on the German 1.4 system) and my grade point average at the end of the year was 3.16/4 (on the German 1.8 system). I was honor student at the end of the semester. I took break to learn German after my first year of study. I took part in German classes at the TU Braunschweig. During this time, I followed the business and computer science courses on the "MIT OpenCourseWare" YouTube channel. I volunteered at ParkRun Braunschweig events and helped out as a running leader. When I came to Germany, I passed the C1 German exam in 3 months and got my admission from the TU Braunschweig.

My current research covers car engines, simple and everyday electronics, computer hardware, civil aviation, android development, economics, renewable energy and recycling. So far, I have built many console applications/software using Java and Python. For example, I have created many software such as autonomous vehicle, autonomous computer player, brain tumor and pneumonia detection, text recognition, object recognition, data visualization, regression analysis. I am very interested in machine learning and deep learning. I'm also interested in "object recognition". I programmed computer games with Unity on C#. In the future, I would like to develop further in the fields of artificial intelligence, integrated circuits and economics. I would like to do a double degree in economics or electrical engineering in the future. I would like to play guitar and piano later. I have two apps in the play store. I've uploaded some of the projects I've developed so far to my YouTube channel. You can access it at this link:
